          Hello, my name is Albert Balbon and Welcome to my Online Portfolio Page. Here you will
          find a short introduction about myself, my resume, contact information, and
          project portfolio.

        <h2 id="introHeading">Short Introduction</h3>
        <p id="introBody">
          I am an aspiring Software Engineer currently studying to get my Bachelor's Degree
          in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton. My biggest interest
          within the realm of Computer Science deal with Embedded Systems. I love working with
          hardware and find the bridge between hardware and software very interesting. My interest
          in microcontrollers and such has lead me to join the Titan Rover Club at Cal State Fullerton.
          This has given me the opportunity to work with industry standard software and hardware components.
          Outside of Computer Science, I love outdoor activities such as hiking and camping. Other
          interests that I have also include motorsports and cars in general. In this page you may find
          some photos of my other interests.
