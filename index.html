      <h2>Cars</h2>

      <p class="cars-paragraph">
        My interests in cars came from my friends that enjoyed working on Cars
        and going to car shows. The passion they had for cars was amazing to see
        which in turn turned me into a car lover. This resulted into me purchasing
        an old car as a project to restore it.

      <p class=outdoors-paragraph>
        My love for the outdoors stemmed from my Dad. As a kid, he used to take
        me and my brothers camping and hiking. Although my brothers were not really
        up to it, I on the otherhand fell in love. Most vacations that I plan
        revolve around the outdoors. Some of my favorite places that I've been to include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Glacier National Park</li>
        <li>Zion National Park</li>
        <li>Grand Teton National Park</li>
        <li>Yosemite National Park</li>
        <li>Joshua Tree</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Video Games</h2>
      <p class="videogame-pargraph">
        Ever since I was a kid, I remember watching my older brothers play Resident
        Evil in the PS1. I was never old enough to play so I always watched everytime
        they started playing. Today, me and my friends use videogames as a way of
        keeping in touch eventhough we live far away. Video games has played a huge
        part in my life in keeping old friends as well as making new ones.
