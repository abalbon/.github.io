      <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Hello Everyone! My name is Albert Balbon and I'm a Computer Science
      Major at Cal State Fullerton. I transferred from Saddleback College
      in 2017. It took me three different majors until I finally decided
      in pursuing Computer Science Some of my interests include:
    <ul>
      <li>Cars</li>
      <li>Camping</li>
      <li>Hiking</li>
      <li>Video Games</li>
      <li>Road Trips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cars</h2>

      My interests in cars came from my friends that enjoyed working on Cars
      and going to car shows. The passion they had for cars was amazing to see
      which in turn turned me into a car lover. This resulted into me purchasing
      an old car as a project to restore it.

    <h2>Outdoors</h2>

    <p>
      My love for the outdoors stemmed from my Dad. As a kid, he used to take
      me and my brothers camping and hiking. Although my brothers were not really
      up to it, I on the otherhand fell in love. Most vacations that I plan
      revolve around the outdoors. Some of my favorite places that I've been to include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Glacier National Park</li>
      <li>Zion National Park</li>
      <li>Grand Teton National Park</li>
      <li>Yosemite National Park</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>
      Ever since I was a kid, I remember watching my older brothers play Resident
      Evil in the PS1. I was never old enough to play so I always watched everytime
      they started playing. Today, me and my friends use videogames as a way of
      keeping in touch eventhough we live far away. Video games has played a huge
      part in my life in keeping old friends as well as making new ones.
