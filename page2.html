      <h1>WHY WEB-FRONT END ENGINEERING?</h1>
      <p>
        Since CPSC 349 was one of the electives offered for me to graduate,
        I had to take it... All jokes aside, I think Web Development and
        Engineering is one of the more essential skills when looking to
        succeed in the Industry. Other than that, Who doesn't want to learn
        how to essentially build a website! Ever since the internet was a thing,
        people never think about how everything came about. A few of us such as
        me and everyone in this class are very interested as to what goes on
        in website design and engineering.
      </p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Prior to this class, I had absolutely zero experience with web applications
      or any sort of web design/engineering. I have heard of HTML, JavaSript,
      and PHP and that's about it. This class will be my introduction to
      web engineering of any sort.
    </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
      By the end of this five week class, I intend to be proficient in all the
      necessary languages needed to excel in web engineering regarding the front
      end. Although it is very different to the Web-Back End Engineering class,
      I hope that this class will help me become sucessful when I take that class
      next semester. One personal summer project that I would like to start is
      to build at least a decent looking html page.
