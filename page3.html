    <h2>Tortilla Hotdog</h2>

    <p>
      A long time ago, in a city called Big Sur in Central California
      not very far away.

    <h2>One Lap Wonder</h2>

    <p>
      The first time I took my car to the track it broke down. The second
      time I took it to the track, it caught on fire. This was taken after
      the fire died down. Luckily the car lived to tell the tale and I was
      eventually able to fix it. To this day, the car still only has done
      one lap around a track thus my friends and I call it the One Lap Wonder
    </p>

    <h2>My Check Engine Light Was On</h2>

    <p>
      This picture was taken during our repair of the car. We had to replace
      the engine and this was my first time ever pulling an engine out of a
      car. I find it interesting because I find it very weird when there's
      no engine in the car. I spent some time sitting insinde the engine bay
      cleaning and thinking how weird it was.
