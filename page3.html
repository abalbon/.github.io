      <h2>Tortilla Hotdog</h2>

      <p>
        A long time ago, in a city called Big Sur in Central California
        not very far away, my friends and I went camping. We've exhausted all
        the food that made sense and we were left with a bunch of different
        food that did not go well together. This was the first one we tried
        and by far the most successful. It's essentially a hotdog wrapped in
        warm tortilla.

      <h2>One Lap Wonder</h2>

      <p>
        The first time I took my car to the track it broke down. The second
        time I took it to the track, it caught on fire. This was taken after
        the fire died down. Luckily the car lived to tell the tale and I was
        eventually able to fix it. To this day, the car still only has done
        one lap around a track thus my friends and I call it the One Lap Wonder

      <h2>My Check Engine Light Was On!</h2>
      <img src="/img/img2.jpg" width= 600 alt="Dude Where's my Engine?">
      <p>
        This picture was taken during our repair of the car. We had to replace
        the engine and this was my first time ever pulling an engine out of a
        car. I find it interesting because I find it very weird that there's
        no engine in the car. I spent some time sitting inside the engine bay
        cleaning and thinking how weird it was.
